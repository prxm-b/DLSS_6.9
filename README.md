# DLSS_6.9
DLSS 6.9 is just a fake FPS counter, making your games always run above 1000fps (in appearance)

As Nvidia qualify AI generated frames as real world performance, marketing it's RTX 5070 as powerful as an RTX 4090, I tought a fake FPS counter could mean any GPU have any performance we want. This programs allows any GPU to performs between 1000 and 1500fps in any games or applications at any settings, making even my Intel Integrated it more powerful in appearance than an RTX 5090
